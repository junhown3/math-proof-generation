Each summand in the sum is called a part. \\begin{enumerate} \\item A partition of $n$ is said to be a \\emph{distinct} partition of $n$ if each part of it is different from the other parts. \\item A partition (resp. composition) of $n$ is said to be a \\emph{binary} partition (resp. composition) of $n$ if each part of it is of the form $2^k$ with integer $k\\geq 0$. \\item A composition of $n$ is said to be a \\emph{Carlitz} composition of $n$ if each part of it is different from its adjacent parts. \\item A composition of $n$ is said to be a \\emph{Carlitz-binary} composition of $n$ if it is both Carlitz and binary. \\end{enumerate}",
