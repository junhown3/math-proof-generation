These come from weighting each chosen part by −1.\n- Multiplying ∑ N_A^p(n)x^n by ∏(1−x^a) collapses p_A(x) against it and leaves τ_A(x); similarly, multiplying ∑ N_A^q(n)x^n by ∏(1+x^a)^{-1} collapses q_A(x) and leaves τ_A^s(x).\n- Extracting coefficients yields the desired convolution inversions: the sums with weights q_A^e−q_A^o and p_A^e−p_A^o give τ_A(n) and τ_A^s(n), respectively.\n\n### Proof\nWe work in the ring of formal power series in x. Let A be any (finite or infinite) set of positive integers; all products below are well-defined as formal series because the coefficient of x^n only depends on finitely many factors.\n\n1) Proof of (a).\nBy Theorem 1(a),\n∑_{n≥1} N_A^p(n)x^n = p_A(x) τ_A(x),\nwhere p_A(x) = ∏_{a∈A} (1−x^a)^{-1} and τ_A(x) = ∑_{b∈A} x^b/(1−x^b) = ∑_{n≥1} τ_A(n"}
